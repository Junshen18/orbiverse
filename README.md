# Orbiverse

**Orbiverse** is a decentralized time capsule dApp built on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the movie *Inside Out*, Orbiverse allows users to create, store, and unlock their memories as glowing orbs, encapsulating emotions, moments, and milestones.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Time-Locked Memories**: Create capsules that unlock on a future date and time.
- **Emotion-Based Design**: Memories are represented as orbs, each with unique colors and animations reflecting the emotions tied to the memory.
- **NFT Ownership**: Every memory orb is an NFT, ensuring ownership and tradability.
- **Secure Storage**: Content is encrypted and stored on decentralized platforms like IPFS.

### Enhanced Functionalities

- **Collaborative Capsules**: Invite others to contribute to a shared orb.
- **Geofenced Capsules**: Restrict unlocking to specific physical locations.
- **Dynamic Orbs**: Memories evolve with additional content or interaction over time.
- **Thematic Customization**: Personalize your memory orbs with themes inspired by special events or milestones.
